#Outline:
#
#1. Title Card
#2. Code Bank
#3. Quip Bank
#4. Round Loop
    #While Player wants to continue playing, loop continues
    #Round Loop: sections 4-12
#5. Letter Encryption
    #Each letter of alphabet assigned a new letter as code
        #No duplicates
    #No repeats
    #Make sure different
#6. Quip Selection and Encryption
    #Quip selected from quip bank
    #Each letter encrypted from code determined by Letter Encryption section
#7. Hint Selection
    #Vowels that are in the quip are added to a hint bank
#8. Puzzle Section
    #puzzle is printed, along with one, random hint from the hint bank.
    #Users are given the option to Answer, get a Hint, or Yield.
    #Users can earn points per round. Total score is kept.
    #Puzzle Loop: sections 8-12
#9. Answer Option
    #Users given chance to input puzzle answer.
    #If the answer is exactly equal to the quip, the loop exits
    #User awarded points based on how many hints used
    #If incorrect, kicks back to beginning of Puzzle Loop
#10. Yield Option
    #If user gives up, the quip is printed
#11. Hint section
    #A random, unique hint from the hint bank is selected
    #Once all hints used, hint option removed
#12. Play Again
    #If user plays again, restarts Round Loop
        #AKA new encryption, new quip, etc.
    #If user ends game, total score from all rounds is printed
    #Used quips tracked. If all quips used, game ends automatically.
#Wish List:
    #High score storage system
    #Timer?
